Usage:

- Install dependencies iin venv (``python -m pip install -r requirements.txt``)
- Change value of constants ``SOURCE_PATH`` and ``TARGET_PATH`` in ``sort_them.py`` (DON'T USE SLASHES AS ESCAPE CHARACTERS FOR THINGS LIKE SPACES. DO NOT JUST COPY FROM TERMINAL!)
- Run ``python sort_them.py``

This creates a file `doubles.list` containing files that are doubles. To remove them, run `python remove_doubles.py`.
